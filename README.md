# golden

A benchmark for compile-time and/or runtime Nim.

Currently pretty crude, but things are coming together.

## Usage
```
$ golden somesource.nim
# compiles your code with -d:danger and runs it many times
# ctrl-c when you've had enough
```

## Theory of Operation

### Measure something, anything

We don't currently measure anything, so the bar is pretty low, here.

### Tell me something true, and as cheaply as possible

Provide answers commensurate with the complexity of the request.

### The more money I put in, the more truth I want

You pour; I'll say "when".

### The more I spend, the more valuable your memory

Truth is hardwon, and probably moreso than memory.

### Be useful to humans

Your user is interactive.

### Be useful to code

Oh, let them eat cake!

### I don't want to know how the sausage is made

Nothing good ever came of it.

### But I might want to provide some of the ingredients

Sure, sure, we'll use 'em.
